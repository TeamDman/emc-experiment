Here is an AI summary.

**A concise, semantic overview** — this repository is an archival research snapshot containing experiments, analysis, and tooling related to deriving and exploring "EMC" values and conversion relationships discovered during work on a Minecraft 1.19.2 codebase.

## What this project is 🧪
- An exploratory collection of scripts, tools, and artifacts used to analyze item conversions and compute EMC-like values.
- Focused on data analysis, derivation logic, and small-scale tooling rather than a packaged or production-ready library.

## Key components 🔍
- `emc_finder/` — a Rust-based toolset for discovering conversion relationships and running preprocessing steps for derivation.
- `explore.ipynb` — interactive notebook(s) used for data exploration and hypothesis checking.
- Generated data and outputs — experimental artifacts (JSONs, intermediate data) produced while deriving values.

## Research goals 🎯
- Discover consistent conversion rules and infer EMC values across items.
- Validate derivation logic and detect edge cases, loops, or inconsistencies in conversion graphs.
- Provide reproducible artifacts and provenance for these experiments.
